# Diet Program

This is a simple node/react website that will display the Diet Program that was supposed to be featured in Lume Wellness app of 2016. Due to the company closing, the diet program was never released, therefore people didn't get to use and understand it, and the current records of it are in documents and xml files. These are not readable. I wanted to make a way for people to be able to see and use the diet program.
